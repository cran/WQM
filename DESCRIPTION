Description: The wavelet-based quantile mapping (WQM) technique is designed to correct biases in spatio-temporal precipitation forecasts across multiple time scales. The WQM method effectively enhances forecast accuracy by generating an ensemble of precipitation forecasts that account for uncertainties in the prediction process. For a comprehensive overview of the methodologies employed in this package, please refer to Jiang, Z., and Johnson, F. (2023) <doi:10.1029/2022EF003350>. The package relies on two packages for continuous wavelet transforms: 'WaveletComp', which can be installed automatically, and 'wmtsa', which is optional and available from the CRAN archive <https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/wmtsa/>. Users need to manually install 'wmtsa' from this archive if they prefer to use 'wmtsa' based decomposition.
